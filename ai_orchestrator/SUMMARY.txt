   - QUICKSTART.md for new users
   - .env.example with all configuration options
   - CHANGES.md documenting all modifications

3. EASIER TO USE
   - Simplified Makefile commands
   - make start (instead of make start-enhanced)
   - make setup (instead of make setup-enhanced-chat)
   - Clear help text

4. PRODUCTION READY
   - Removed test files and examples
   - Consolidated functionality
   - Better error handling
   - Improved logging

QUICK START (for users):
================================================================================

1. Install dependencies:     make install
2. Setup configuration:      cp .env.example .env (then edit)
3. Setup database:           make setup
4. Start chat server:        make start

✓ Chat context storage
✓ Admin web UI
✓ gRPC API
✓ All database schemas
✓ All tool integrations

Nothing was removed from functionality - only duplicate/unused code was cleaned up.
